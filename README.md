## Issues
- no validation of input on new product form yet
- id and price from form are coming through as strings - this does *not* appear to break any of the math, but I will probably want to do some typecasting for peace of mind

## Wishlist
- create a remove product feature on the admin page
- create a remove item feature on each line item in the cart
- add a list display on the admin page to show the current product catalog/show as entries are added or removed
